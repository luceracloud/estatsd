This applicaion acts as a common interface for monioring utils, abstracting the actual implementation of the monitoring
API. Currently it uses estatsd for actual monitoring, but that might change in the future. Note that this application
also offers a couple of wrappers for generating Key names according to the company policy.

Currently, for a proper usage of this application you should configure estatsd as shown in the conf folder.
